# Family Recipe App

This is a simple web app for tracking family recipes. Built using Node.JS and React with TypeScript.  App is used regularly by family to simplify our lives in the kitchen.  App was built after repeated frustration and up-sells by other commercial offerings.

Features:

- Maintains a database of recipes with a cooking mode viewer.  Original import done by scrapping our Pepperplate account.
- Ingredients are stored in a "canonical" format where all recipes refer to the same core items. This makes it possible to quickly add recipes and maintain clean data.  Custom interface to maintain these ingredients.
- Meal planning allows for tracking a week and creating a shopping list
- Shopping list integrated with Kroger API allowing for item searches and Kroger cart creation
