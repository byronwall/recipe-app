[To Freeze and Cook Later]
Label your freezer bag with the name of the recipe, cooking instructions, and“use-by” date (which will be three months from the prep date).
Add all ingredients to your freezer bag except water and potatoes.
Remove as much air as possible, seal, and freeze.
Place bag of potatoes in freezer.

[To Cook]
Thaw freezer bag overnight in refrigerator or in water in the morning.
The morning of cooking, pour contents into your crockpot; add water and frozen potatoes. (I don’t thaw my potatoes because I worry about them getting brown while cooking.)
Cook on “low” setting for 4 hours in a 6-quart crockpot or 8 hours in a 4-quart crockpot.
